# Potato Disease Classification üç†üå±  

This project is a **Potato Disease Classification System** that leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify potato leaves into three categories:  
- **Healthy**  
- **Early Blight**  
- **Late Blight**  

The system achieves an impressive **96% accuracy** in classification, offering a robust solution for identifying common potato plant diseases through images.
